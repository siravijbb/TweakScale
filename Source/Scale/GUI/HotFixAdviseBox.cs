A hot fix is a patch crafted to reach the intended results by brute force to solve problems diagnosed but that cannot be fixed by normal means (as pull requesting the fix to the offending Add'On repository).

It's safe to start new games and share crafts - but you can have problems by installing or removing Add'Ons, as hot fixes are usually dumb and aimed to a specific situation.";
