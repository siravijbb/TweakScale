# TweakScale :: Known Issues

* As from 2.5.0.x, TweakScale is now **double licensed** under the SKL 1.0 and GPL 2.0.
	+ All the previous releases until 2.4.3.x are still licensed under the WTFPL license.
	+ All artefacts on the Extras directory are still licensed under the WTFPL.
	+ See the [README](./README.md) for details.
	+ Scaled parts with Variants now correctly translates the attached part when applying variants #HURRAY
		- As long the part has no symmetry, when things get completely screwed up...
		- See [this comment](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/issues/42#issuecomment-732321477) on [Issue #42](https://gi
* KSP 1.9 is known to mangle with Attachment Points the same way it does with Resources.
	+ This affects every Add'On that changes the Part's Attachment Node.
	+ [KSP Recall](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/KSP-Recall/issues/9) will tackle this down on the near future.
* The FTE-1 Drain Vale (ReleaseValve - new on KSP 1.9.x) is not being properly scaled. Only the size (and Mass) are scalable, the functionality is not.
	+ See Issue [#102](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/issues/102) for details. 
* KSP 1.9.0 introduced a new glitch (still persisting on KSP 1.9.1, and **fixed** on KSP 1.10.0) where any change on the Part's Resources are overridden on cloning.
	+ This affects every Add'On that changes the Part's Resource.
	+ This misbehaviour is fixed by installing [KSP Recall](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/192048-*).
		- Users of TweakScale on KSP 1.9.x are advised to install KSP Recall immediately. 
* A change on the Add'On Binder demanded that only **one** Scale_Redist.dll be available on the whole installment.
	+ Delete every single file called `Scale_Redist.dll` from every Add'On you have installed
	+ Don't touch `999_Scale_Redist.dll` on the GameData. This one must stay.
* There're some glitches on KSP 1.8.0 that prevents TweakScale (and any other Add'On using `UI_ScaleEdit` and `UI_FloatEdit`) to correctly display the PAW.
	+ It's **strongly** advised to do not use TweakScale on 1.8.0
	+ But nothing bad will happen, other than a hard time trying to use the PAWs.
* A new and definitively destructive *"Unholly Interactions Between Modules"*, or as it's fondly known by its friends, **Kraken Food**, was found due some old or badly written patches ends up injecting TweakScale properties **twice** on the Node.
	+ This is particularly nasty as it corrupts a previously working GameDatabase that infects your savegames with corrupted part info. Once a new Add'On is installed, or the bad one is uninstalled, suddenly all your savegames with the old, corrupted part info became broken. See details on the [Issue #34](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/issues/34).
	+ This was considered **FATAL** as previously perfectly fine parts became corrupted by installing a rogue Patch, that can so be uninstalled later ruining savegames. By that reason, a very scaring warning are being issue in the Main Menu when the problem is detected.
* There's a crashing situation when using TweakScale and [Classic Infernal Robotics](https://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/InfernalRobotics).
	+ IR parts scaled down to "Small -" (small minus, the smallest of them) crashes the game when the craft is unpacked.
	+ Apparently quitting immediately KSP, restarting, reloading the game and recovering the vessel from the Track Station is enough to salvage the savegame - but more tests are needed to be sure of that.

	+ TweakScale advises all IR users to update to [Infernal Robotics/Next](https://github.com/meirumeiru/InfernalRobotics) where this issue was solved.
* There's a potentially destructive problem happening due *"Unholly Interactions Between Modules"*, or as it's fondly known by its friends, **Kraken Food**. :)
	+ Due events absolutely beyond the TweakScale scope of actions,  some parts are being injected with more than one instance of TweakScale. This usually happens by faulty MM patches, but in the end this can happens by code or even by editing MM's cache.
		- Things appear to work fine, except by some double Tweakables on the UI. However, crafts and savagames get corrupted when loaded by sane KSP installments, as the duplicates now takes precedence on loading config data, overwriting the real ones.
		- **Things become very ugly when by absolutely any reason (new add-on installed or deleted, or even updated) the glitch is fixed on the MM cache. Now, your KSP installment is a sane one, and all your crafts (including the flying ones) will lose their TweakScale settings!**
	+ So, before any fix is attempted to the problem, TweakScale now is taking some measures to preserve your craft settings from being overwritten once the craft is loaded into a sane installment.
		- Keep in mind, however, that TweakScale acts on **SAVING** data. You need to load and save every craft and savegame using the latest TweakScale as soon as you can. 
	+ A proper fix to the root cause, now, is not only beyound the reach of TweakScale, **as it's also destructive**. Only after TweakScale 2.4.1 or beyound are mainstream for some time it will be safe to do something about - and by then, something else will probably be needed to rescue old crafts and savegames. 
* TweakScale 2.4.x is known to (purposely) withdraw support for some parts on runtime. This, unfortunately, damages crafts at loading (including from flying ones) as the TweakScale data plain vanishes and the part goes back to stock.
	+ Parts being deactivated are being logged into KSP.log, pinpointing to an URL where the issue it causes is described. TweakScale **does not** hides from you what it's being done.
	+ This is unavoidable, unfortunately, as the alternative is a fatal corruption of the game state (persisted on savegames) that leads to blowing statics and ultimately game crash.
	+ The Maintainer is terribly sorry for the mess (my savegames gone *kaput* too), but it's the less evil of the available choices.
	+ The proposed mitigation measure is to backup your savegames, try TweakScale 2.4.x and then decide if the damages (if any, only a few parts are affected) are bigger than the risks - but then, make **hourly** backups of your savegames as one the misbehaviour is triggered, your savegame can be doomed and forever leading to crashes.
